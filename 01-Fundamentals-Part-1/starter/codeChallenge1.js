// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.
// DATA 1
// const weightM = 78;
// const heightM = 1.69;
// const weightJ = 92;
// const heightJ = 1.95;
// DATA 2
const weightM = 95;
const heightM = 1.88;
const weightJ = 85;
const heightJ = 1.76;
const bmiM = weightM / heightM ** 2;
const bmiJ = weightJ / heightJ ** 2;
const markHigherBMI = bmiM > bmiJ;
console.log(bmiM, bmiJ, markHigherBMI);
